## Mining
- When miners mine blocks, all they do is change the `nonce` value until the hash of the block is at the target hash value or lower than the target hash value.
- Changing the `nonce` will change the hash of the block.
- The first miner to generate a hash at or below the target hash, wins and gets to mine the block to the blockchain.
- Miners are nodes on the blockchain, pretty much just computers running special software.
- If the hashing algorithm gets cracked then the proof of work model will be useless because people will cheat the system to always mine blocks first and reduce the workload to mine.
- The target hash value is a random number generated just to merely act as a hurdle for miners when they are mining blocks.
